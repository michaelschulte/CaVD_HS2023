Dear all,

welcome to "Communicating and Visualizing Data with R".

I am looking forward spending time with you this fall working on awesome visualizations of interesting data.

We will meet Fridays (first time September, 22nd, 2023, @13.15) in Room 107 (E8).

In order to get us going I want to share the general outline of the course with you: https://michaelschulte.github.io/CaVD_HS2023/ 

I will also add you to a Team on Teams (weird naming convention) to have a common communcation channel - no question on the content of the course is off limits there!

BEFORE we get going next week I want you to do two things:

1) please go through the installation instructions for R and RStudio here: https://michaelschulte.github.io/CaVD_HS2023/installation.html and install the described software on your laptop. If possible also run the code under point 2 in the console of RStudio (I can help you with this step if you run into troubles - drop me a line on Teams or we will do this in person next week).

2) Think about a dataset you want to visualize. A central task in this course will be work on your own data visualization - this means ideally you will have a question for an existing dataset you want to answer. This can be data out of your MA thesis work or other stuff you are interested in. There are many open source datasets available (again, if you need help to find something drop me a line on Teams). 

That's it.

I am looking forward seeing you next week!

Best
Michael
